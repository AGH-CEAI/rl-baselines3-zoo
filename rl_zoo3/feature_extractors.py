class AbstractVisionExtractor(BaseFeaturesExtractor, ABC):
    """
    An abstract class for preparing pre-defined vision feature extractors,
    like CNN, VAE, ViT, M. Hopfield etc.

    It adds an extra nn.Linear layer with the selected activation function for
    scaling the output number of features.

    If the observation consists of stacked frames, these frames will be split
    and given to the feature extractor separately.

    :param observation_space:
    :param normalized_image: Whether to assume that the image is already normalized
        or not (this disables dtype and bounds checks): when True, it only checks that
        the space is a Box and has 3 dimensions.
        Otherwise, it checks that it has expected dtype (uint8)
        and bounds (values in [0, 255]).
    :param out_features_per_frame: Number of extracted features from a single image.
        This corresponds to the number of unit in the last layer.
        If the frames are stacked, the output dimension will be equal to
        out_features_per_frame * stacking_frames.
    :param linear_activation_fn: The activation function to use after the last layer.
    :param stacking_frames: The number of the stacked frames.
        Must be the same as the hyperparamter `frame_stack`.
    :param frame_channels: The number of color channels in the input images.
        Typically (1) for monochromatic, (3) for RGB and (4) for RGBD.
